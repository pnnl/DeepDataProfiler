Deep Data Profiler (DDP)
========================

The Deep Data Profiler library provides tools for analyzing the internal decision structure of a deep neural network within the
context of a specific dataset. The library was inspired by the work of Qiu, et al. in Adversarial Defense Through
Network Profiling Based Path Extraction (2019), arXiv:1904.08089.
  

The current version is preliminary. We are actively testing and would be grateful 
for comments and suggestions.  Expect changes in both class names and methods as 
many of the requirements demanded of the library are worked out. 

We've included a tutorial to introduce you to the concepts behind DDPs:
