Deep Data Profiler (DDP)
========================

Description
===========
The `DeepDataProfiler`_ library provides tools for analyzing the internal decision structure of a deep neural network within the
context of a specific dataset. The Deep Data Profiler project is part of the Mathematics of Artificial Reasoning in Science (MARS)
Initiative at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).
Research was conducted under the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program at PNNL,
a multiprogram national laboratory operated by Battelle for the U.S. Department of Energy.
